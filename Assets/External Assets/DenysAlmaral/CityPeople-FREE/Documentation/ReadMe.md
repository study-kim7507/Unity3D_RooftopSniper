- **Characters with disabilities**:
  - Each has 3 tailored animations specific to their design and mobility aids: Idle, forward and talk.

## CityPeople Component Script

Located in the `Scripts` folder, the **CityPeople** component script offers basic functionality to control character behaviors and appearances. 

### Key Features

- **Material Switching Method**: Easily change a character's material palette using the new method: `public void SetPalette(Material mat)`
  - **Usage**: This method replaces materials with the `people_pal` prefix while leaving other materials untouched.
- **Auto Play Animation:** Setting this field to `True` in the inspector makes the character switch animations randomly for testing and demonstration purposes. 

## Palette System and UV
![](images/PaletteTextures.png)
The characters UV have been mapped in a way to make easy the switching of palettes. These textures (acting as palettes) have a standardized structure with areas corresponding to different surfaces of the characters:

- Skin colors
- Hair colors
- Clothes colors
- Dark and Light details.

A single texture/material pair can be applied to all the characters in this package. And any texture/material can be applied to any character.

Free tool [DA Poly Paint](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/painting/da-polypaint-low-poly-customizer-251157) can be used to further modify the UV 'painting' by model with ease.

## URP Support

To ensure compatibility with projects using the Universal Render Pipeline:

1. **URP active:** Ensure Universal Renderer Pipeline is configured first.
2. **Navigate**: Go to the `URP` folder in the package.
3. **Install**: Import the`Mateials_URP (DoubleClickMe).unitypackage`.
4. **Update Materials**: This will replace all standard materials with URP-ready alternatives.

## Unity 6 Compatibility

The **City People Mega-Pack** has been thoroughly tested with Unity 6 to guarantee seamless integration:

- **Performance**: Optimized for the latest Unity engine enhancements.
- **Features**: Fully compatible with new Unity 6 features and improvements.
